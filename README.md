As we approach the end of Moore's scaling, architects are increasingly turning towards massively heterogeneous systems where multiple acceleartors do the heavy-lifting in domain-specific workloads.
This change can already be seen in modern architectures with multiple accelerators. However, the systems community has not paid enough attention towards this rapidly changing scenario. Today's OSes 
do not manage the accelerator's scheduling requirements.

In this work, we demonstrate several variants of centralized schedulers that manage these accelerators, hence bringing OS into picture for fair scheduling.
